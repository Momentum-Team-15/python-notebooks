# Intro to Python Notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Momentum-Team-9/python-notebooks/main)

These notebooks introduce you topic by topic to the Python language. You can run the code contained in each notebook, and you can edit it to see how it works.

To run these notebooks locally, clone this repo. Make sure you have Jupyter installed. You can then run the notebooks by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

[You can also go straight to live notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Momentum-Team-9/python-notebooks/main) (also by clicking on the "launch binder" icon above).
